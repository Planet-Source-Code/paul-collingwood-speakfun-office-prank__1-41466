These two applications show the principles of triggering actions on a remote machine.
It's quite a good prank as well!

NO EXPLICIT DAMAGE is caused by using this application - I use the work 'victim' in the lightest of senses!

Compile SpeakFun project, and install it on victim's PC.
Then run SpeakFun - no dialog will appear - the program will run covertly.

Compile SpeakFunSend project, and install it on your PC.
Then run SpeakFunSend - select PC of victim (either from LAN list or explicit IP address) and send text strings!

Once the SpeakFun application is running, it will auto-start every time the victim's PC is rebooted.
On a PC running Windows 95, 98, or Me you can't even see it in the task-list (Ctrl-Alt-Del) so its difficult to remove!

Remember! - if you could get into trouble using this in your workplace/school then DONT USE IT!

Have fun
Paul
